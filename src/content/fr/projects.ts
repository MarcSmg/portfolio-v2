            This project originates from a real need I encountered as a musician: 
            finding accurate chord shapes quickly without breaking creative focus.

        solution: `
            The goal is to allow users to search for chords by name or select from a curated list, then generate clear chord diagrams along with common inversions. 
            These diagrams will be exportable as SVG, PNG, or JPEG for reuse in arrangements, sheet music, or educational material.
